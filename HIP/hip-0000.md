## Abstract
This HIP extends HIP-756 by allowing smart contracts to utilize the Hedera
Schedule Service (HSS) for any possible smart contract call.

## Motivation
HIP-755 extended the ability to schedule transactions to the Hedera Smart
Contract Service. While this is very useful for smart contract calls by
externally owned accounts (EOAs), it requires off-chain coordination and
it does not extend to smart contracts calling other smart contracts as the 
origin of the transaction. Furthermore, HIP-755 does not fully support
regularly scheduled transactions, as the off-chain signatures and message
submission must be repeated for each transaction.

Extending HIP-756 to call contracts in the future would enable recursive
execution and rescheduling of contract calls, resulting in a 'set it and forget
it' system by which contract calls can be made at regularly scheduled intervals
as long as the transaction payer has enough hbar to cover the gas and scheduled
contract call fee.

## Rationale
This HIP provides the possiblility to have fully on-chain 'cron jobs' regularly
call smart contracts that to this point have been done manually or through a web
server.

## User stories
1. As a smart contract developer, I want to reduce my technical overhead through
having a contract call itself or other contracts

Useful examples for this upgrade could include: rebalancing DeFi positions,
claiming tokens from vesting contracts at regular intervals, and changing token
statuses at a predetermined epoch time in the future.

## Specification
The ledger HSCS will utilize the existing HSS but with more generality via
`IHederaScheduleService.sol`.

### HSS System Contract
The `IHederaScheduleService.sol` interface must be updated to support everything
needed to run any smart contract call.

## Backwards Compatibility
No existing features are modified as this only exposes HAPI functionality to smart
contracts.

## Security Implications
No additional security concerns

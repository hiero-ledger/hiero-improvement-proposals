## Abstract
This proposal builds upon [HIP 1137: Block Node discoverability via on chain registry](https://hips.hedera.com/hip/hip-1137)
and provides an approach for the network to reward Tier 1 Block Node operators. Consensus Nodes will utilize account
`0.0.801` to issue additional Tier 1 Block Node daily reward transfer transactions to the node AccountId for operational
and node rewards eligible consensus nodes. A node AccountId will receive this additional reward if the address book
entry for that node contains the `registered_node_id` of an active Block Node in its `associated_registered_node` field.

## Motivation
Block nodes provide a community service by decentralizing network data storage and ensuring blocks are distributed
with diverse ownership. Operating these nodes requires acquiring and maintaining hosting servers, along with ongoing
upgrades and maintenance. Tier 1 block nodes (block nodes that receive block streams directly from a consensus node)
especially will require a high service quality level in operations. Tier 1 block node operators should be rewarded for
providing these fundamental services and ensuring consensus nodes have a reliable location to push blocks.

Additionally, Tier 1 block operators are also council consensus node operators. Having all their node operation
rewards designated in one place and distributed to the same AccountId is valuable.

## Rationale
Each `Node` entry in the consensus node state has an `associated_registered_node` field. This field
if populated, contains the `registered_node_id` values of registered nodes operated by the same entity. If that list
contains the `registered_node_id` of a registered node with the Block Node type, then the Account associated with
that `Node` is eligible to receive daily rewards for operating a Tier 1 block node.  

An additional configuration, `nodes.targetYearlyBlockNodeRewardsUsd`, will be added to the consensus node configs.
`nodes.targetYearlyBlockNodeRewardsUsd`: A target yearly block node reward amount in USD. This is the estimated dollar
cost of operating a Tier 1 block node that is distributed to all registered Tier 1 block node operators. 

The amount specified by `nodes.targetYearlyBlockNodeRewardsUsd` will be divided by the number of staking periods per
year and converted to the native cryptocurrency to determine the daily reward issued to each block node operator.

## User stories
1. **As a Tier 1 block node operator**, I want to be rewarded for my services in full time operation of a block node.
2. **As a Hiero network governing authority** (e.g., Hedera Council), I want to be able to designate the total yearly
    cost the network is willing to pay a block node operator in a year for their services.

## Specification
During nightly reward fee calculations, when a `Node` in state is found to be eligible for consensus node rewards (based
on participation in enough consensus rounds) the logic may iterate of over the non-null `Node.associated_registered_node`
list. If an entry is found to match a registered node of type `BLOCK_NODE` then the network should issue an additional 
`CryptoTransfer` of `(targetYearlyBlockNodeRewardsUsd ($) / # of staking periods per year) * exchangeRate (h/$)`
to the `Node.AccountId`.

This ensures that governing authority members only receive block node rewards if they satisfy both consensus and block
node operation obligations.


### Consensus Node Specification

Add a `targetYearlyBlockNodeRewardsUsd` config property to the NodesConfig.

## Backwards Compatibility
This HIP makes no changes to network protobuf spec or state and thus maintains backwards
compatibility.

## Security Implications
No changes to transaction signing or authority rules are made. No new entry or exit pathways are added.

## How to Teach This


## Reference Implementation


## Rejected Ideas

### Unique Reward AccountIds
It was proposed that the HIP should support two distinct operator `AccountId` values, one to receive consensus node rewards
and the other to receive block node rewards. It was acknowledged as a good idea but not mandated for this HIP.
It may be explored in the future but for now it's easier for a council operator to receive rewards for both eligible
counsensus and block nodes on the same `AccountId`.

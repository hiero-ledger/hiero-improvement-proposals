## Abstract
This proposal builds upon [HIP 1137: Block Node discoverability via the network address book](https://hips.hedera.com/hip/hip-1137)
and provides an approach for the network to reward Tier 1 Block Node operators. Consensus Nodes will utilize account
`0.0.801` to issue daily reward transfer transactions to Block Node `DiscoverableAddressBookNode` types whose
`enable_node_rewards` have been set to `true` by the network.

## Motivation
Block nodes provide a community service by decentralizing network data storage and ensuring blocks are distributed
with diverse ownership. Operating these nodes requires acquiring and maintaining hosting servers, along with ongoing
upgrades and maintenance. Tier 1 block nodes (block nodes that receive block streams directly from a consensus node)
especially will require a high service quality level in operations. Tier 1 block node operators should be rewarded for
providing these fundamental services and ensuring consensus nodes have a reliable location to push blocks.

Additionally, Tier 1 block operators are also council consensus node operators. Having all their node operation
rewards designated in one place and distributed to the same AccountId is valuable.

## Rationale
Each `DiscoverableAddressBookNode` entry in the consensus node state has an `enable_node_rewards` flag. This flag
indicates whether the AccountId owner is eligible to receive daily rewards for operating a Tier 1 block node. 

An additional configuration, `nodes.targetYearlyBlockNodeRewardsUsd`, will be added to the consensus node configs.
`nodes.targetYearlyBlockNodeRewardsUsd`: A target yearly block node reward amount in USD. This is the estimated dollar
cost of operating a Tier 1 block node that is distributed to all registered Tier 1 block node operators. 

The amount specified by `nodes.targetYearlyBlockNodeRewardsUsd` will be divided by the number of staking periods per
year and converted to the native cryptocurrency to determine the daily reward issued to each block node operator.

## User stories
1. **As a Tier 1 block node operator**, I want to be rewarded for my services in full time operation of a block node.
2. **As a Hiero network governing authority** (e.g., Hedera Council), I want to be able to designate the total yearly
    cost the network is willing to pay a block node operator in a year for their services.

## Specification
During nightly reward fee calculations, a consensus node iterates over all `BLOCK_NODE` discoverable node type objects
in state and checks if their `enable_node_rewards` flag is set to `true`. If the flag is true and the accountId is also
eligible for consensus node rewards (based on participation in enough consensus rounds), the network issues a
`CryptoTransfer` of `(targetYearlyBlockNodeRewardsUsd ($) / # of staking periods per year) * exchangeRate (h/$)`.

This ensures that governing authority members only receive block node rewards if they satisfy both consensus and block
node operation obligations.


### Consensus Node Specification

Add a `targetYearlyBlockNodeRewardsUsd` config property to the NodesConfig.

## Backwards Compatibility
This HIP makes no changes to network protobuf spec or state and thus maintains backwards
compatibility.

## Security Implications
No changes to transaction signing or authority rules are made. No new entry or exit pathways are added.

## How to Teach This


## Reference Implementation


## Rejected Ideas


## Open Issues

1. Must an AccountId be associated with an operational CN and BN prior to being eligible for BN Tier 1 rewards? There
  may be legitimate cases where a CN node operator may have different AccountIds across node types

## Abstract

Raises the limit on the size of `EthereumTransaction` callData to 128KB, and the limit on the total size of an
`EthereumTransaction` from 6KB to 130KB. Introduce a new throttle bucket that represents the max bytes-per-second of
the network, such that each node gets 1/N of that throttle bucket (using our existing throttle system). Introduce
non-linear pricing for transactions larger than 6KB to incentivize smaller sized transactions where possible.

## Motivation

Ethereum and other EVM networks permit up to 128KB of data in a call, whereas Hedera transactions can be no larger than
6KB. Many smart contracts are much larger than 6KB and have to be broken up into multiple `FileAppend` transactions and
use the Hedera File Service (HFS). Not only does this lead to a poor developer experience, but it makes operating a
JSON-RPC relay difficult and expensive. By permitting transactions to use all 128KB, we improve Ethereum compatibility,
developer experience, and make it easier to operate a JSON-RPC relay.

## Rationale

Hedera limits all transactions to a maximum size of 6KB. By limiting the size of transactions, Hedera makes it easier
for clients to get fair access to the network. Ethereum, on the other hand, supports callData sizes of up to 128KB. The
6KB limit is highly problematic for developer experience, and unexpectedly, for network efficiency. This is especially
true when creating contracts, and for oracles sending large amounts of data to the network.

When creating a new smart contract, if the smart contract bytecode and all other bytes for the EthereumTransaction
(including signatures) together exceed 6KB, then the user cannot simply create a contract the way they would on Ethereum
or other networks. They must instead use the Hedera File Service (HFS) to create a file, and then call ContractCreate
with that function. This has several challenges:

- The workflow for Hedera is different from Ethereum and other EVM networks
- Uploading a file is expensive, and requires multiple transactions (since the file upload itself is also limited to
  6KB per transaction)
- The file, if not deleted after use, takes up storage space needlessly
- If the smart contract has already been deployed and the user has a lot of callData (such as an oracle with a large
  amount of data), then the user likewise must use HFS to upload the callData in chunks to a file on chain, and then
  issue an EthereumTransaction in such a way as to use that previously uploaded file as the callData.
- Overall deployment / call latency is increased due to the need to upload files and then reference them in the
  `EthereumTransaction`

In addition, JSON-RPC relays need to find a business model whereby they can charge users for these HFS transactions.
This creates a poor developer experience. This again breaks the business model of many cross chain relay operators and
makes access to cheap relays difficult.

## User stories

1. As an `EOA` submitting a transaction with large call data I expect the network to accept my transaction and charge me
   the appropriate amount of gas.
2. As a `relay` I want to provide a service for users where they can submit and pay for transactions without increasing
   my own costs or establishing an out-of-band business model for working with users.
  
## Specification

 - Permit `EthereumTransaction` callData (called `ethereum_data` in the protobuf) to be as large as 128KB
 - The entire transaction, including signatures, shall not exceed 130KB
 - Increase the price-per-byte non-linearly to encourage smaller transactions
 - Institute a network-wide throttle on bytes-per-second for "jumbo" `EthereumTransaction`s

### Services

A new throttle bucket will be introduced that represents the max bytes-per-second of the network, such that each node
gets 1/N of that throttle bucket (using our existing throttle system). If an `EthereumTransaction` is received that
exceeds 6KB in size, then it is classified as a "jumbo" transaction. In addition to the normal throttle limits, the
number of bytes exceeding 6KB will be added to the 'jumbo' throttle bucket. If the bucket does not have capacity, then
the transaction will be rejected.

In addition, the price of the transaction will be increased non-linearly for transactions that exceed 6KB in size. The
actual pricing will be determined by the Hedera Council and specified as part of the network configuration. The price
will **not** affect the gas, but **will** affect the exchange rate between gas and USD.

A JSON-RPC relay *should* calculate the HBAR cost of the transaction and verify the sender has sufficient funds before
sending the transaction to the network to avoid due diligence failure fees.

This HIP only designates jumbo `EthereumTransactions`. Any other transactions exceeding 6KB should be rejected.

The configured value for the size of an event should be set to permit at least one full-sized jumbo
`EthereumTransaction`.

### SDK

Today, if a user wants to create a contract with a large amount of callData, they must first upload the callData to a
file in the HFS, and then reference that file in the `EthereumTransaction`. The SDK attempts to manage this complexity
for the user automatically. With this HIP, SDKs should be updated to automatically use jumbo transactions when the
callData exceeds 6KB. The SDK should support an option to use HFS for callData if the user prefers to manage the
complexity themselves.

### Mirror Node

A Mirror Node should not require any changes. While the size of the `EthereumTransaction` will be larger, and therefore
the reason for using HFS will be lessened, the Mirror Node should be able to handle both jumbo transactions and legacy
HFS-based `EthereumTransaction`s.

### Relay

The JSON-RPC relay will be updated to use jumbo transactions. It will no longer use files for large callData. 

## Backwards Compatibility

Behavior for the consensus node is fully backwards compatible. The default behavior for SDKs will change to use
jumbo transactions, which may surprise users who are not expecting the change, and the overall cost may be higher than
if the user had used HFS. However, the user can still use HFS if they prefer.

Users of a JSON-RPC relay may see the price in HBAR change as a result of jumbo transactions. They will also see in the
Mirror Node Explorer a single large transaction rather than many small transactions (`FileCreate` and `FileAppend`)
followed by one small `EthereumTransaction`.

## Security Implications

The consensus node will need to take care when ingesting data. Today, with a limit of 6KB, the consensus node can
maintain very small memory buffers for each connection. The consensus node should now be updated to allow "linking"
smaller buffers together when needed for jumbo transactions. This keeps memory usage minimal (vs. if every buffer was
"jumbo" sized).

## How to Teach This

With this HIP, the behavior of `EthereumTransaction` will now match expectations for Ethereum developers. There should
be documentation added to docs.hedera.com to cover `EthereumTransaction` and the documentation for the SDKs should be
updated. The main point to be described to users will be how the jumbo transactions are priced and throttled.

## Abstract
This HIP establishes the registry entry for Hiero Consensus Standards (HCS). It links to the canonical specifications in the `hiero-consensus-specifications` repository and pins the current published versions to a specific commit for reproducibility. No protocol behavior changes are introduced; this is a documentation and traceability artifact. HIP-1364 serves as an index; per HCS standard, the individual pointers are separate files (not HIPs) stored alongside this HIP.

## Motivation
The Hiero Consensus Standards have been migrated to `hiero-consensus-specifications`. The TSC requested a stable, reviewable pointer in the HIPs repository so downstream consumers, auditors, and tooling can track which specification versions are current. Recording the canonical source and commit hash here reduces ambiguity and aligns lifecycle management with the process defined in HCS-4. Each HCS specification has a dedicated pointer file in this repository; these pointer files are not HIPs and contain no specification text.

## Specification
Relationship to HIPs: HIPs continue to govern network-level and core protocol changes. HCS specifications define application-layer metaprotocols evaluated on the Consensus Service and do not modify network behavior. HIP-1364 exists only as an index of Published HCS specifications and does not embed specification text.

Pointer files: each HCS specification has a dedicated pointer file in the `HCS/` directory of this repository. These files are not HIPs. They record:
- specification name and identifier (for example, HCS-1),
- version identifier (recorded as “current” plus the pinned commit),
- lifecycle status,
- canonical repository and path,
- pinned commit SHA.

Canonical source: https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero-consensus-specifications pinned to commit `675f6d06450c72c63f52191eb090e7b2bdbb405c`.

Pointer index (see `HCS/` directory for details):
- HCS-1 → HCS/hcs-1.md
- HCS-2 → HCS/hcs-2.md
- HCS-3 → HCS/hcs-3.md
- HCS-4 → HCS/hcs-4.md
- HCS-5 → HCS/hcs-5.md
- HCS-6 → HCS/hcs-6.md
- HCS-7 → HCS/hcs-7.md
- HCS-8 → HCS/hcs-8.md
- HCS-9 → HCS/hcs-9.md
- HCS-10 → HCS/hcs-10.md
- HCS-11 → HCS/hcs-11.md
- HCS-12 → HCS/hcs-12.md
- HCS-13 → HCS/hcs-13.md
- HCS-14 → HCS/hcs-14.md
- HCS-15 → HCS/hcs-15.md
- HCS-16 → HCS/hcs-16.md
- HCS-17 → HCS/hcs-17.md
- HCS-18 → HCS/hcs-18.md
- HCS-19 → HCS/hcs-19.md
- HCS-20 → HCS/hcs-20.md
- HCS-21 → HCS/hcs-21.md
- HCS-XX template → HCS/hcs-xx.md
- Shared definitions → HCS/hcs-definitions.md

Lifecycle and update process: changes to any specification follow HCS-4. When a new version is approved and merged, the corresponding pointer file is updated with the new version identifier, status, and pinned commit, and this HIP remains as the index that references those pointers.

## Backwards Compatibility
This HIP is informational and does not alter protocol behavior.

## Security Implications
None. The HIP records documentation locations only.

## How to Teach This
Refer implementers and reviewers to the table above and to HCS-4 for the lifecycle workflow. The specifications are implemented in the Hiero ecosystem SDKs; see https://hol.org/docs/libraries/standards-sdk/overview for library support.

## Reference Implementation
Not applicable. Implementations are maintained alongside each specification within or downstream of `hiero-consensus-specifications`.

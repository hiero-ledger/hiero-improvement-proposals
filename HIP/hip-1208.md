## Abstract

This proposal enables direct interoperability from Smart Contracts to topics created using the Hedera Consensus Service(HCS). It specifies a precompiled contract that allows smart contracts to natively write messages to HCS topics. This enables real-time event logging, verifiable off-chain messaging, and cross-application coordination without external intermediaries like oracles as defined by [HIP-478](https://hips.hedera.com/hip/hip-478), laying the foundation for a fully integrated, event-driven architecture on Hiero.

## Motivation

Developers will be able to leverage HCS topics for secure, verifiable messaging and event tracking directly within smart contract logic, opening up use cases such as decentralized coordination, event-driven automation, and consensus-based attestations. By providing a native “write” capability, this HIP removes a significant barrier for developers, simplifying architectures and reducing reliance on centralized components.

## Rationale

Allowing smart contracts to natively write to HCs topics enables applications to maintain tamper-proof records and create verifiable off-chain attestations. For example:

- A smart contract can emit events to topics that external applications listen to.
- Multiple smart contracts on the network and external applications(off-chain) can coordinate by having trusted contracts post messages to shared topics.

To bridge the HSCS and HCS, this proposal utilizes the EVM’s precompiled contract facility. When a contract calls the precompile, a `ConsensusSubmitMessageTransaction` is staged as a child transaction. This child transaction is only processed by the network after the parent smart contract transaction has achieved consensus and successfully completed its execution. This two-phase approach, modeled on the HTS precompiles([HIP-206](https://hips.hedera.com/hip/hip-206)), preserves EVM determinism while enabling native HCS write access. The mainnet provides the trusted consensus layer that ensures all participants see the same sequence of events.

This model requires the precompile to accept a budget for the child transaction's network fees, as message sizes can be variable. This network fee budget is functionally distinct from any application-level custom fees defined by a topic operator (per [HIP-991](https://hips.hedera.com/hip/hip-991)), which must be consented to separately by the original transaction payer.

## User stories

- **As a developer**, I want my smart contract to write data to HCS topics to enable automated event logging and cross-application messaging.
- **As an enterprise**, I want to use HCS topics as a decentralized messaging layer where trusted smart contracts can post state changes to coordinate with other on-chain and off-chain applications.
- **As a DAO developer**, I want my governance contract, upon a successful vote, to automatically publish the outcome hash to an HCS topic, creating an immutable audit trail.
- **As a DeFi protocol developer**, I want my smart contract to atomically execute a token swap and, if successful, record the transaction details to a permissioned HCS topic for regulatory compliance, all orchestrated deterministically by a single smart contract
- **As a game developer**, I want my on-chain game contract, when a player achieves a global milestone, to send a verified achievement to an HCS topic for off-chain leaderboards to consume
- **As an exchange operator**, I want to install a hook([HIP-1195](https://hips.hedera.com/hip/hip-1195)) on my main treasury account that triggers on any outgoing `CryptoTransfer`, calling the HCS precompile to log the transaction details to our private audit topic, with the fee paid by the initiator.

## Specification

#### Precompile Address

A new precompile address will be designated (e.g., 0x16A - official address to be assigned later). The precompile input data will follow the calling conventions of the Solidity ABI.

#### Solidity Interface and Function Signature

```
interface IHCS {
   /// @notice Instructs the Hiero network to generate and process a child
   ///     ConsensusSubmitMessageTransaction.
   /// @param topic The address-encoded representation of the Hiero Topic ID.
   /// @param message The raw byte content of the message to be submitted.
   /// @param maxHCSTxFeeBudget The maximum HBAR fee for the child transaction.
   ///     This is distinct from the gas cost of calling this precompile.
   /// @return responseCode A standard Hiero ResponseCode enum value.
   function submitMessage(
       address topic,
       bytes calldata message,
       uint64 maxHCSTxFeeBudget
   ) external returns (int64 responseCode);
}
```

The ABI signature and hash for the call are as follows:

| hash         | signature                             | return                 |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `0x9ab57774` | `submitMessage(address,bytes,uint64)` | `(int64 responseCode)` |

The `maxHCSTxFeeBudget` parameter is required because the fee for a `ConsensusSubmitMessageTransaction` is variable based on the size of the `message`. This explicit budgeting for network costs is distinct from the `max_custom_fees` field on a parent transaction, which is used to authorize any operator-defined custom fees per HIP-991. The budgeting also makes HCS submissions from contracts robust against `INSUFFICIENT_TX_FEE` failures.

#### Precompile Transaction Records

To ensure traceability, this precompile will utilize the existing child transaction record mechanism specified in [HIP-206](https://hips.hedera.com/hip/hip-206).

- **TransactionID `nonce` field**: The child `ConsensusSubmitMessageTransaction` will be assigned the next sequential `nonce` value available within the parent transaction’s context.
- **TransactionRecord `parent_consensus_timestamp` field**: The record of the child HCS transaction will populate this field with the consensus timestamp of its parent `ContractCallTransaction`, creating a verifiable link.

#### Querying Child Transactions

Support for querying child transactions will follow the standard established in [HIP-206](https://hips.hedera.com/hip/hip-206). Mirror node queries for a transaction record can set a flag like `include_child_records` to `true` to retrieve the records of any child transactions spawned by the parent.

## Backwards Compatibility

The implementation maintains backward compatibility with existing HCS and Smart Contract systems. Applications currently using either system independently can continue to do so without modification. The integration layer adds new capabilities without breaking existing functionality.

## Security Implications

To maintain security and prevent unauthorized interaction with HCS topics:

- **Permission Control**: If a topic has a `submitKey`, a contract can only write to it if the contract's own ID(e.g., 0.0.1234) is part of that `submitKey`. Authorization is tied to the contract itself, not the user calling the contract.
- **Message Size and Content**: The precompile will enforce HCS message size limits(e.g. 1024 bytes).
- **Topic Integrity**: Contracts will not be able to delete or modify existing HCS topics. The creation of HCS topics will still be done through existing HCS APIs via Hiero SDK.
- **Fee Management**: The `maxHCSTxFeeBudget` must be budgeted carefully. If set too low for the message size, the child transaction will fail post-consensus, even if the parent transaction succeeded.
- **Asynchronous Confirmation**: A `SUCCESS` response from the precompile only confirms the message was staged. Finality must be confirmed by finding the child transaction record off-chain.
- **Interaction with Custom Topic Fees (HIP-991)**: The introduction of custom fees on HCS topics has significant security implications for this precompile, especially when used with automated systems like EVM Hooks.
  - **Risk of Unexpected Charges**: A malicious actor could install a hook on their account that calls this precompile to write to a topic with an exorbitant custom fee. An unsuspecting user interacting with that account (e.g., via a simple `CryptoTransfer`) could be exposed to this fee without their consent.
  - **Required Network Safeguard**: To prevent this, the network protocol must enforce that a child transaction cannot assess a custom fee against a payer unless that payer has explicitly budgeted for it in the parent transaction's `max_custom_fees` field. In the absence of this explicit consent in the parent transaction, the child transaction must fail, protecting the user from non-consensual charges.
  - **hcsTransactionFee vs. Custom Fees**: It must be understood that the `maxHCSTxFeeBudget` parameter in the `submitMessage` function is a budget for network/node fees only. It does not authorize the payment of operator-defined custom fees.
  - **Safe Use with Hooks**: For the hook use case to be safe and predictable, the hook installer should ensure the target HCS topic has the installer's key on its `FeeExemptKeyList`(as defined in HIP-991). This allows the hook to write to the topic without incurring custom fees for the user who triggers the hook, as the custom fee is waived for the exempt key.

## How to Teach This

Documentation will emphasize the asynchronous nature of the precompile. The recommended workflow is:

1. **Call Precompile**: A developer calls `IHCS(PRECOMPILE_ADDRESS).submitMessage(topic, message, maxHCSTxFeeBudget)` from their contract and verifies the returned `responseCode` is `SUCCESS`.
2. **Emit Event**: The contract emits a domain-specific event(e.g. `ReceiptLogged(orderId)`) to signal the action to the off-chain world.
3. **Confirm Off-Chain**: An off-chain service listens for the event, gets the parent transaction ID, and queries a mirror node for its record, including child records. It can then find the `ConsensusSubmitMessageTransaction` child record to get its final `consensusTimestamp` and `sequenceNumber`.
4. **Note on Custom Fees**: Developers should be taught that if a contract may interact with topics that have custom fees (per HIP-991), the user initiating the transaction must be made aware of these potential fees. For developers building hooks that write to HCS, the strongly recommended best practice is to use topics where the hook installer's key is on the `FeeExemptKeyList` to ensure a safe and predictable experience for all users.

## Reference Implementation

A reference implementation will be required as part of making this HIP "Final." This will include:

- The precompile implementation within the Hedera node software.
- Example smart contracts demonstrating its usage.
- Thorough test cases covering successful submissions, validation failures, and post-consensus submission scenarios (including failures).

## Rejected Ideas

- **Smart Contract-Based HCS Message Reading**: The ability for contracts to directly read HCS messages poses significant challenges regarding EVM determinism and efficient access to the historical state. While highly desirable, this complex feature requires a separate, dedicated proposal and is considered out of scope for this HIP, which focuses on the "write" capability.

## Open Issues

- The precise gas cost for the precompile call needs to be finalized based on implementation benchmarking.
- Whether or not to refund the unused `maxHCSTxFeeBudget` back to the user needs to be finalized.
- Add in Topic (no custom fees) create, update, delete.
- Add in read Topic info from the state.

## Abstract

This proposal specifies a precompiled contract to enable comprehensive, native interoperability between the Hedera Smart Contract Service(HSCS) and the Hedera Consensus Service(HCS). This integration allows smart contracts to programmatically manage the full lifecycle of HCS topics - including creation, updates, deletion and information retrieval - and to submit messages. It features automatic message chunking to support large data payloads, making HCS a fully-featured, first-class citizen of the Hiero smart contract ecosystem. When it comes to writing to a topic, it enables real-time event logging, verifiable off-chain messaging, and cross-application coordination without external intermediaries like oracles as defined by [HIP-478](https://hips.hedera.com/hip/hip-478), laying the foundation for a fully integrated, event-driven architecture on Hiero.

## Motivation

Developers will be able to leverage HCS topics for secure, verifiable messaging and event tracking directly within smart contract logic. By enabling full topic lifecycle management including a native “write” capability, this HIP removes a significant barrier for developers, simplifying architectures and reducing reliance on centralized components. We also unlock more sophisticated use cases, simplify developer workflows, and empower developers to build powerful, event-driven, on-chain applications without external intermediaries.

## Rationale

Allowing smart contracts to natively interact with HCS topics enables applications to maintain tamper-proof records and create verifiable off-chain attestations. For example:

- A smart contract can emit events to topics that external applications listen to.
- Multiple smart contracts on Hiero and external applications can coordinate by having trusted contracts post messages to shared topics.

To bridge the HSCS and HCS, this proposal utilizes the EVM’s precompiled contract facility. All state-modifying operations(`createTopic`, `updateTopic`, `deleteTopic`, `submitMessage`) are implemented via the child transaction model established in [HIP-206](https://hips.hedera.com/hip/hip-206) to preserve EVM determinism. Read-only operations(`getTopicInfo`) are implemented as synchronous state reads.

With jumbo transaction support([HIP-1086](https://hips.hedera.com/hip/hip-1086)) enabling calldata up to 128KiB, smart contracts can now receive large data payloads. However, a child `ConsensusSubmitMessageTransaction` is still subject to the standard ~6KiB network transaction size limit. This HIP addresses this limit by building automatic message chunking into the `submitMessage` precompile.

## User stories

- **As a smart contract developer**, I want my smart contract to create, update, and delete HCS topics to manage temporary event logs for user sessions or game matches.
- **As an enterprise**, I want to use HCS topics as a decentralized messaging layer where trusted smart contracts can post state changes to coordinate with other on-chain and off-chain applications.
- **As a DAO developer**, I want my governance contract, upon a successful vote, to automatically publish the outcome hash to an HCS topic, creating an immutable audit trail.
- **As a DeFi protocol developer**, I want my smart contract to atomically execute a token swap and, if successful, record the transaction details to a permissioned HCS topic for regulatory compliance, all orchestrated deterministically by a single smart contract.
- **As a game developer**, I want my on-chain game contract to `getTopicInfo` to verify a topic’s keys before sending a verified achievement to an HCS topic for off-chain leaderboards to consume
- **As an exchange operator**, I want to install a hook([HIP-1195](https://hips.hedera.com/hip/hip-1195)) on my main treasury account that triggers on any outgoing `CryptoTransfer`, calling the HCS precompile to log the transaction details to our private, fee-exempt audit topic.

## Specification

#### Precompile Address

A new precompile address will be designated (e.g., 0x16A - official address to be assigned later). The precompile input data will follow the calling conventions of the Solidity ABI.

#### Solidity Interface and Function Signature

```solidity
// NOTE: The 'Key' struct is a simplified representation of
// a Hedera Key, to be fully defined. It can represent a
// contractID, ED25519 key, etc.
struct Key {
  // ... Key structure details
}

// A payload used ONLY for creating a new topic. It excludes
// all fee-related fields, as this precompile does not
// support creating topics with custom fees
struct TopicCreatePayload {
   string memo;
   Key adminKey;
   Key submitKey;
   uint64 autoRenewPeriod;
   address autoRenewAccount;
}

// Represents a single fixed fee entry, returned
// by getTopicInfo
struct FixedFee {
   uint64 amount;
   address collectorAccountId;
   address denominatingTokenId; // address(0) for HBAR
}

// Represents the complete custom fee schedule,
// returned by getTopicInfo
struct CustomFee {
   uint64 createdTimestamp;
   FixedFee[] fixedFees;
}

// A comprehensive data structure returned by getTopicInfo,
// containing all available topic properties, including
// custom fee schedules.
struct TopicInfo {
   string memo;
   Key adminKey;
   Key submitKey;
   uint64 autoRenewPeriod;
   address autoRenewAccount;
   // HIP-991 Fee-related fields
   Key feeScheduleKey;
   Key[] feeExemptKeyList;
   CustomFee customFees;
}

interface IHCS {
   function createTopic(TopicCreatePayload memory payload) external returns(int64 responseCode, address topicAddress);
   // Note: updateTopic also uses a restricted payload to prevent
   // fee schedule modification.
   function updateTopic(address topic, TopicCreatePayload memory payload) external returns (int64 responseCode);
   function deleteTopic(address topic) external returns (int64 responseCode);
   function getTopicInfo(address topic) external view returns (int64 responseCode, TopicInfo memory info);
   function submitMessage(address topic, bytes calldata message, uint64 maxHCSTxFeeBudget) external returns (int64 responseCode);
}
```

#### Function Behavior

- **createTopic, updateTopic**: These functions explicitly use the `TopicCreatePayload` struct, which prevents developers from attempting to set custom fee schedules. This enforces the scope of the HIP at the contract interface level. It stages the corresponding child transactions(ConsensusCreateTopic, etc). The `adminKey` and `submitKey` can be set to the contract’s own address(`address(this)`) to give it control over the topic. The precompile will enforce that the `autoRenewAccount` field, if set, must be either the address of the calling contract or the original payer of the parent transaction(tx.origin). Specifying any other account will result in a failure with an `INVALID_AUTORENEW_ACCOUNT` response code. The `adminKey` and `submitKey` fields do not require such a signature check, as setting them defines control rather than imposing a financial obligation.
- **deleteTopic**: This function is authorized by the topic’s `adminKey`. It can delete a topic regardless of whether that topic has an existing custom fee schedule.
- **getTopicInfo**: This is a synchronous read-only call that returns the topic’s metadata. It does not generate a child transaction. It returns the comprehensive `TopicInfo` struct, providing read-only access to all topic properties, including the full custom fee schedule. This allows smart contracts to become “fee-aware”.
- **submitMessage**: This function can submit messages to any topic, including those with custom fees. It also supports automatic message chunking. If the message payload is larger than the ~6KiB single transaction limit, the precompile will automatically calculate the number of chunks required, validate the `maxHCSTxFeeBudget` against the total cost for all chunks, and stage N child transactions automatically.

#### Function ABI signature and hash

| hash         | signature                                                  | return                                                                                   |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `0x93f506c3` | `createTopic((string,bytes,bytes,uint64,address))`         | `(int64,address)`                                                                        |
| `0xf01c877c` | `updateTopic(address,(string,bytes,bytes,uint64,address))` | `(int64)`                                                                                |
| `0x77d2d828` | `deleteTopic(address)`                                     | `(int64)`                                                                                |
| `0x0e34dbed` | `getTopicInfo(address)`                                    | `(int64,(string,bytes,bytes,uint64,address,(bytes,bytes[],(uint64,address,address)[])))` |
| `0xccebe938` | `submitMessage(address,bytes,uint64)`                      | `(int64)`                                                                                |

The `maxHCSTxFeeBudget` parameter on `submitMessage` is required because the network fee for a `ConsensusSubmitMessageTransaction` is variable based on the size of the message. This explicit budgeting for network costs is distinct from the `max_custom_fees` field on a parent transaction, which is used to authorize any operator-defined custom fees per HIP-991. The budgeting also makes HCS submissions from contracts robust against `INSUFFICIENT_TX_FEE` failures.

#### Precompile Transaction Records

To ensure traceability, the state-modifying precompile functions will utilize the existing child transaction record mechanism specified in [HIP-206](https://hips.hedera.com/hip/hip-206). These child records appear in the record stream immediately following the parent’s record within the same consensus block. Finality and consensus details must be confirmed by querying a mirror node for the parent transaction record with a flag such as include_child_records=true.

## Backwards Compatibility

The implementation maintains backward compatibility with existing HCS and Smart Contract systems. Applications currently using either system independently can continue to do so without modification. The integration layer adds new capabilities without breaking existing functionality.

## Security Implications

To maintain security and prevent unauthorized interaction with HCS topics:

- **Permission Control and Key Management**: Authorization is tied to the contract’s ID. If a topic has an `adminKey` or `submitKey`, the permission check is satisfied if the `contractID` of the calling smart contract is included in that key structure. The contract’s call to the precompile serves as its “signature” for authorization.
- **Fee management**: The `maxHCSTxFeeBudget` parameter in the `submitMessage` function is a budget for the network transaction fees only. It must be budgeted carefully. If set too low for the message size, the child transaction will fail with `INSUFFICIENT_TX_FEE`.
- **Asynchronous Confirmation**: A `SUCCESS` response from a state-modifying precompile call only confirms the message was successfully staged. Finality must be confirmed by finding the child transaction record via a mirror node.
- **Smart Contract Trust**: Users interacting with smart contracts that call this precompile must trust the contract’s code. A malicious contract could be designed to submit messages to topics with high custom fees(per [HIP-991](https://hips.hedera.com/hip/hip-991)) and the user who signs the transaction calling the contract would be liable for those fees. It is the responsibility of the user and their wallet to audit and consent to the full effects of a smart contract interaction.

## How to Teach This

Documentation will provide a holistic guide to managing HCS topics from Solidity, covering the full lifecycle and emphasizing the asynchronous nature of state-modifying calls. It will include clear examples and best practices for key management. It is important to teach that confirming the outcome of a `submitMessage` or other stateful call requires querying a mirror node for the child transaction record.

## Reference Implementation

A reference implementation will be required as part of making this HIP "Final." This will include:

- The precompile implementation within the Hiero node software.
- Example smart contracts demonstrating its usage.
- Thorough test cases covering successful submissions, validation failures, and post-consensus submission scenarios (including failures).

## Rejected Ideas

- **Reading HCS Messages from a Smart Contract**: The ability for contracts to directly read HCS messages poses significant challenges regarding EVM determinism and efficient access to the historical state. While highly desirable, this complex feature requires a separate, dedicated proposal and is considered out of scope for this HIP. This HIP only enables reading topic metadata(`getTopicInfo`).
- **Creating/Updating Topics with a Custom Fee Schedule**: To reduce the initial implementation scope, setting custom fees via this precompile is not included.

## Open Issues

- The precise gas cost for the precompile call needs to be finalized.
- Whether or not to refund the unused `maxHCSTxFeeBudget` back to the user needs to be finalized.
- The detailed specification for the `Key` struct representation in Solidity needs to be defined.

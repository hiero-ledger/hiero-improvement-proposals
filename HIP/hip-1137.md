## Abstract
With the addition of Block Nodes to the Hiero ledger, clients will need a
reliable mechanism to find functioning block nodes. This HIP proposes to add
a new type of node registry, and transactions to enable block node
operators to add and manage their nodes in the network.

## Motivation
Block Nodes are a critical component of any Hiero ledger. The Block Nodes
manage and provide access to Block Stream and state snapshot data, as well
as content proof for both blocks and state. Block Nodes may also provide
additional value-add services integral to their core function, and may charge
fees for providing both core and value-add services to clients. A service
is of no value, however, if the service provider cannot be found. Offering a
mechanism to find a Block Node by querying network state ensures a reliable
and trustworthy source of data that is dynamically managed and updated by the
Block Node operators themselves.

## Rationale
Discoverability of services is critical to a broadly useful network and
effective development of network applications. The addition of basic node
registry functionality supports the current addition of block nodes to the
network, and lays groundwork for adding additional discovery mechanisms in
future proposals. While the proximate motivation for this capability is to
enable discoverability of block nodes, it is also clear that block nodes are
not the only form of registered nodes that could, or should, be published
on the blockchain.

## Definitions
<dl>
<dt>Registered Node</dt>
<dd>A node that participates in an Hiero Ledger network, but is not a consensus
node, is a registered node, and may be discovered via a node discovery process.
Registered nodes do not require on-chain upgrade coordination and are generally
managed as fully independent individual entities. Each type of registered node
has its own mechanism for discovering and using resources specific to that type
of node. The registry only provides the type of node and one or more service
endpoints.</dd>
<dt>Network Governance</dt>
<dd>Any process, account, set of accounts, smart contract, or other structure
designated by the collective operators and/or owners of a particular Hiero
network to govern the network and ensure that network-wide decisions are proper
and correctly effected. One example is the Hedera governing council.</dd>
</dl>

## User stories
1. As a RPC Relay client, I wish to find an RPC relay using on-chain data.
1. As a Block Node, I need to connect to other block nodes found by inspecting
   block stream data.
1. As a Mirror Node, I want to present registered nodes to clients using
   on-chain data.
1. As a developer of distributed applications I want to find block nodes,
   mirror nodes, and other network nodes that I can use during operation.
1. As a developer of distributed applications I want to know that the operator
   of each node I use has an on-chain identity.
1. As an Hiero community member, I want to operate a registered node and
   publish the type and endpoints on-chain so that others can find my service.
1. As a registered node operator, I want to manage my registered node on an
   Hiero ledger so that clients can reliably find and connect to my service over
   time.
1. As the operator of a private Hiero ledger, I want to manage the registered
   nodes relevant to my ledger using on-chain data.
1. As an Hiero network governing entity I want the option to identify trusted
   providers of critical network infrastructure services on-chain.
1. As an Hiero network governing entity I want the option to remove obsolete or
   misbehaving registered nodes.
1. As an Hiero network governing entity I want to ensure that creation of
   registered nodes occurs at a reasonable rate and the fees fully compensate
   the network for the long-term cost of maintaining the list of registered
   nodes.
1. As an Hiero consensus node operator I want to identify registered nodes that
   I also operate, and enable my nodes to mutually discover that association.

## Specification
This HIP proposes the introduction of additional NodeService APIs that enable a
registered node operator to create, delete, and update registered nodes.

Several messages refer to a "Registered Node ID". This is a single entity number
that is assigned on node creation by the network, and is unique within a
particular shard and realm. Registered nodes are specific to a shard and realm,
although nothing technically prevents a single system from being registered as a
node in multiple shards or multiple realms. The consensus network may assign any
value to a new node, except that a given Node ID must never be reused within a
given shard or realm. The Node ID values for Registered Nodes must not match the
Node ID value for any consensus node in the same network.

### New API Elements

```protobuf
service AddressBookService {
    // [...]

    /**
     * A transaction to create a new registered node in the network
     * address book.
     * <p>
     * This transaction, once complete, SHALL add a new registered node to the
     * network state.<br/>
     * The new registered node SHALL be visible and discoverable upon
     * completion of this transaction.
     */
    rpc createRegisteredNode (proto.Transaction) returns (proto.TransactionResponse);

    /**
     * A transaction to remove a registered node from the network address
     * book.
     * <p>
     * This transaction, once complete, SHALL remove the identified registered
     * node from the network state.<br/>
     * This transaction MUST be signed by the existing entry `admin_key` or
     * authorized by the Hiero network governance structure.
     */
    rpc deleteRegisteredNode (proto.Transaction) returns (proto.TransactionResponse);

    /**
     * A transaction to update an existing registered node in the network
     * address book.
     * <p>
     * This transaction, once complete, SHALL modify the identified registered
     * node state as requested.
     */
    rpc updateRegisteredNode (proto.Transaction) returns (proto.TransactionResponse);
}
```

A new Hiero API element will be added, named RegisteredServiceEndpoint.

```protobuf
/**
 * A registered network node endpoint.<br/>
 * Each registered network node in the global address book publishes one or
 * more endpoints which enable the nodes to communicate both with other
 * nodes and with clients to receive requests.
 *
 * This message supports a TCP port and IP address (V4 or V6),
 * or MAY include a FQDN _instead of_ an IP address.<br/>
 */
message RegisteredServiceEndpoint {
    oneof address {
        /**
         * A 32-bit IPv4 address or 128-bit IPv6 address.<br/>
         * This is the address of the endpoint, encoded in pure "big-endian"
         * (i.e. left to right) order (e.g. `127.0.0.1` has hex bytes in the
         * order `7F`, `00`, `00`, `01` and `::1` is `00`, `00`, `00`, `00`,
         * `00`, `00`, `00`, `00`, `00`, `00`, `00`, `00`, `00`, `00`,
         * `00`, `01`).
         */
        bytes ip_address = 1;

        /**
         * A node domain name.
         * <p>
         * This MUST be the fully qualified domain name of the node.<br/>
         * This value MUST NOT exceed 250 ASCII characters.<br/>
         * This value MUST meet all other DNS name requirements.
         */
        string domain_name = 2;
    }

    /**
     * A network port to use.
     * <p>
     * This value MUST be between 0 and 65535, inclusive.<br/>
     * This value is REQUIRED.
     */
    uint32 port = 3;
    
    /**
     * A flag indicating if this endpoint requires TLS.
     * <p>
     * If this value is set true, then connections to this endpoint MUST
     * enable TLS.
     * <p>
     * TLS endpoints MAY use self-signed certificates for this purpose,
     * but use of self-signed certificates SHOULD be limited to testing and
     * development environments to ensure production environments meet all
     * expected characteristics for transport layer security.
     */
    bool requires_tls = 4;
}
```

A new Hiero API will be added called RegisteredNodeCreate, which falls under
the Node Service category. This function is used by the node operator to create
a new node.

```protobuf
message RegisteredNodeCreateTransactionBody {
    /**
     * An administrative key controlled by the node operator.
     * <p>
     * This key MUST sign this transaction.<br/>
     * This key MUST sign each transaction to update this node.<br/>
     * This field MUST contain a valid `Key` value.<br/>
     * This field is REQUIRED and MUST NOT be set to an empty `KeyList`.<br/>
     * It is RECOMMENDED that this key be composed of one or more unique public
     * keys that are not associated with any network account.<br/>
     * This key MAY be a complex key containing `KeyList` or `ThresholdKey`
     * elements, but SHOULD NOT be a contract ID key.
     */

     */
    RegisteredNodeType node_type = 2;

    /**

     * Multiple endpoints in this list MAY resolve to the same interface.<br/>
     * This list MAY be empty.<br/>
     * This list MUST NOT contain more than `10` entries.
     */
    repeated RegisteredServiceEndpoint service_endpoint = 4;
}

/**

 * 
 * These values SHALL represent all _supported_ registered nodes.
 */
enum RegisteredNodeType {
    /**
     * This value indicates unset or missing data and MUST NOT be used.
     */
    UNKNOWN = 0;

     * A Hiero Mirror Node.<br/>
     * A Mirror Node is an advanced indexing and query service that provides
     * fast and flexible access to query the block chain and transaction
     * history. A Mirror Node typically stores all recent blockchain data, and
     * some store the entire history of the network.
     */
    MIRROR_NODE = 2;

    /**
     * A RPC Relay node.<br/>
     * A RPC Relay Node is a proxy and translator between EVM tooling and a
     * Hiero consensus network.
     */
    RPC_RELAY = 3;
}
```

A new Hiero API called RegisteredNodeDelete will be added under the Node
Service. This API function is used by the node operator to delete a node.
This API function MAY also be used by an Hiero network's governance
structure to administratively delete a registered node when necessary.

```protobuf
message RegisteredNodeDeleteTransactionBody {
    /**
     * A registered node identifier in the network state.
     * <p>
     * The node identified MUST exist in the registered address book.<br/>

     * This value is REQUIRED.
     * <p>
     * A given value for `registered_node_id` SHALL be unique within a given
     * shard or realm.<br/>
     * A given value for `registered_node_id` SHALL NOT be reused, even if the
     * corresponding entry is deleted.
     */
    uint64 registered_node_id = 1;
}
```

A new Hiero API called RegisteredNodeUpdate will be added under the Node
Service. This function is used by the node operator to update a node.

```protobuf
message RegisteredNodeUpdateTransactionBody {
    /**
     * A registered node identifier in the network state.
     * <p>

     */
    repeated RegisteredServiceEndpoint service_endpoint = 4;
}
```

The Hiero consensus network will store registered node information in state
with the following message structure.

```protobuf
message RegisteredNode {
    /**

     * This list SHALL NOT contain more than `10` entries.
     */
    repeated RegisteredServiceEndpoint service_endpoint = 4;
}
```

### Changes to Existing API Elements
Add three HieroFunctionalities:

```protobuf
enum HieroFunctionality {
    // [...]

    /**
    * Create a registered node
    */
    RegisteredNodeCreate = 101;

    /**
     * Update a registered node
     */
    RegisteredNodeUpdate = 102;

    /**
     * Delete a registered node
     */
    RegisteredNodeDelete = 103;
}
```

Add `registered_node_id` in `TransactionReceipt`:

```protobuf
message TransactionReceipt {
    // [...]

    /**
     * The identifier of a newly created RegisteredNode.
     * <p>
     * This value SHALL be set following a `createRegisteredNode`
     * transaction.<br/>
     * This value SHALL NOT be set following any other transaction.<br/>
     * This value SHALL be unique within a given network.
    */
    uint64 registered_node_id = 16;

}
```

Add `associated_registered_node` to the existing Consensus Node "Address Book".
```protobuf
message Node {
    // [...]

    /**
     * A list of registered nodes operated by the same entity as this node.<br/>
     * This value may contain a list of "registered nodes" (as described in
     * HIP-1137) that are operated by the same entity that operates this
     * consensus node.
     * <p>
     * This field is OPTIONAL and MAY be empty.<br/>
     * This field MUST NOT contain more than twenty(20) entries.<br/>
     * Every entry in this list MUST be a valid `registered_node_id` for a
     * current registered node.
     */
    repeated uint64 associated_registered_node = 13;
}

message NodeCreateTransactionBody {
    // [...]

    /**
     * A list of registered nodes operated by the same entity as this node.<br/>
     * This value may contain a list of "registered nodes" (as described in
     * HIP-1137) that are operated by the same entity that operates this
     * consensus node.
     * <p>
     * This field is OPTIONAL and MAY be empty.<br/>
     * This field MUST NOT contain more than twenty(20) entries.<br/>
     * Every entry in this list MUST be a valid `registered_node_id` for a
     * current registered node.
     */
    repeated uint64 associated_registered_node = 10;
}

message NodeUpdateTransactionBody {
    // [...]

    /**
     * A list of registered nodes operated by the same entity as this node.<br/>
     * This value may contain a list of "registered nodes" (as described in
     * HIP-1137) that are operated by the same entity that operates this
     * consensus node.
     * <p>
     * This field is OPTIONAL and MAY be empty.<br/>
     * This field MUST NOT contain more than twenty(20) entries.<br/>
     * Every entry in this list MUST be a valid `registered_node_id` for a
     * current registered node.
     */
    repeated uint64 associated_registered_node = 11;
}

```

### Mirror node update
The mirror node will process the new Registered Node transactions and
registered_service_endpoint information, then return that information through
extensions to its existing APIs or new APIs, as needed.
One _possible_ extension would be to add a `/api/v1/network/registeredNodes`
resource which accepts a `nodeType` query parameter and returns a list of nodes
with that type, or a list of all registered nodes if the parameter is not
supplied.

### SDK Considerations
Each SDK will need to implement the following _new_ transactions.
- `createRegisteredNode`
- `updateRegisteredNode`
- `deleteRegisteredNode`
There is no change to existing transactions. The create transaction sets the
same `registered_node_id` field in the transaction receipt.

## Backwards Compatibility
All changes for this HIP are net-new functionality. There is no predicted
impact or change for existing functionality.

## Security Implications
* The signatory for all registered node transactions (create, update, delete) is
  the assigned `admin_key` value for that node. This maintains management of
  each registered node firmly with the creator/operator. It is RECOMMENDED that
  the `admin_key` be composed of one or more unique public keys that are not
  associated with any network account.
* The network throttles will need to be updated to place appropriate limits on
  the number of registered node transactions. Such transactions should not be
  frequent, and relevant throttles should have corresponding limits.

We do not expect to place any restriction on who can create a registered node,
long term, and the only limitation to who can update or delete a registered
node will eventually be that the transaction must be signed by the `admin_key`
for that node. In the short term, however, some Hiero networks may choose,
as a governance policy, to limit registered node creation until this feature
includes suport for reputation or other functionality not included in the
current proposal.

## How to Teach This
TBD

## Reference Implementation

## Rejected Ideas
1. Use of the existing consensus node address book and transactions was
   considered.
   * This was rejected for three reasons.
      1. The existing Node transactions and state objects include a substantial
         amount of data that has no relevancy to registered nodes
      1. The consensus nodes do not, and should not, include the additional
         information specific to registered nodes
      1. The modification of registered nodes and consensus nodes have
         vastly different risk profiles, and mandate very different signatory
         requirements.

## Open Issues
1. Should we use a full Entity ID (0.0.1234 form) for registered node ID
   values, or is it reasonable to keep just a single integer (e.g. 28 or 18273)
   as the registered node ID.
   * Use of a full entity ID does not add capability and requires storage of
     additional data that raises deceptive implications. It is better to use
     the same model as consensus nodes and store node ID as a single `uint64`.
1. We intended to store a uint64 "reputation" value for each registered node,
   but have not determined an appropriate and workable mechanism for allowing
   network entities to "vote" on that reputation.
   * One concept discussed is to use something similar to a
     "proof of space-time" and a "proof of streaming" for block nodes
     (as one example) as an automated "reputation" modifier. How this would
     be integrated with community sentiment remains an open question.
   * This concept should be the subject of a future HIP.

## Abstract
This proposal introduces the hinTS threshold signature scheme (TSS), designed for Hiero networks to sign blocks within the block stream (HIP-1056). It replaces individual RSA signatures with constant-size, efficiently verifiable signatures that are seamlessly integrated into the block stream.

Currently Hiero networks use record signing in the V6 record stream to ensure integrity, as defined in HIP-415. Each node generates an individual RSA signature on the hash of every block it produces, verified independently by a majority of weighted nodes.

The current RSA-based signing is inefficient. Verifiers must verify RSA keys from multiple nodes  which is computationally costly and will grow as nodes are added to the network. With uniform stake distribution, signature count and verification work scale linearly with node count. Verifying numerous RSA signatures on EVM chains is impractical due to linear scaling and lack of native RSA precompile support.

This HIP proposes the adoption of TSS be introduced alongside HIP-1056â€™s block stream. TSS will produce a constant-size signature per block, simplifying verification for block nodes, mirror nodes and other services, including via EVM smart contracts with gas-efficient precompiles.

TSS provides the following advantages:
Constant-Size Signatures: Signature size remains fixed, regardless of node count or weight distribution, reducing storage and transmission overhead.
Constant-Time Verification: Verification work is independent of network size, improving scalability and enabling efficient EVM integration.

## Motivation
Most consumers of a Hiero network's block stream will need to verify the blocks they receive by checking
the network's signature on the block Merkle tree. Many network clients will also want to verify state proofs
by checking the same signature (since the state Merkle tree is a subtree of the block Merkle tree). It follows
that the cost of verifying block signatures has a large effect on a Hiero network's usability, _especially_
as the network size grows and its history includes many roster and weight changes. For example, suppose a
decentralized finance (DeFi) application wants to respond as soon as possible to state changes that
represent onchain market signals. It must be able to verify each block's signature quickly and cheaply.
As another example, consider inter-ledger communication between Hiero networks and EVM chains. Any such
inter-ledger protocol will need to be based on an efficient threshold signature scheme to keep gas costs
low.

## Rationale
The appeal of the hinTS scheme is described extensively in [1], so we will not repeat each
reason to adopt it in this HIP. The main benefit we do want to emphasize, other than
efficiency, is that hinTS lets nodes be assigned **exact weights**, even at the resolution
of 64-bit stake weights. Moreover, it uses a silent setup, avoiding the communication and 
computation heavy protocols often associated with DKG-based threshold signature schemes.

The support for exact weights is attractive because, for an aBFT proof-of-stake blockchain, the 
**access structure** needed to form a network signature is the agreement of any set of 
nodes holding greater than 1/2 of the total consensus weight. In a Hiero network, consensus 
weights are the whole number of HBARs staked to each node, and the network's HBAR supply
can be configured with 64-bit precision. It follows that the weights in a Hiero threshold
access structure also need 64-bit precision.

Thus, adopting hinTS lets Hiero networks impose exactly the access structure that is
most natural for the aggregate signatures of a proof-of-stake blockchain.

## User stories
- As a Hiero network user, I want to be able to verify the signature of any block proof created 
by the network _without_ keeping the full address book history and the signing (RSA) key of 
every node throughout that history.
- As a Hiero network user, I want to do constant-time work to verify each block proof.
- As a Hiero block node operator, I want concise network signatures to reduce the amount 
of information I need to store and serve to block proof consumers.

## Technical Overview
The hinTS signature on any block `N` attests to the statement that the block's content has been signed (via the BLS 
algorithm) by nodes constituting of greater than 1/2 of the network weight, according to the address book in use for block `N`. 
However, since the network can adopt different address books over time, the statement above must also imply that 
the address book being used in block `N` is a descendent of the genesis address book, wherein each address 
book rotation is authorized via signatures of greater than 1/2 (in weight) of the members of the active address book.

We label each address book with a (public) verification key, which is used to verify that the aggregate BLS signature 
(computed by aggregating the BLS partial signatures) is derived from a threshold fraction of the nodes by weight.
Starting with the genesis address book, each time the network adopts a new address book, it will publish a 
recursive SNARK proof in the block stream that proves the new address book's verification key belongs to the 
network's **chain of trust** -- the witnesses to this recursive SNARK prover algorithm is the prior recursive 
SNARK proof, and a set of Schnorr signatures from members of the prior address book, representing greater than 1/2 amount of weight.
Therefore, in hinTS, each block signature contains the following components: 
  1. a BLS aggregate signature, resulting from combining the partial BLS signatures over that block;
  2. a lightweight SNARK proof proving that the signers in the above BLS aggregate signature comprised of greater than 1/2 of the active 
     address book by weight -- this proof is verified w.r.t. the verification key of the active address book;
  3. a recursive SNARK proof proving that the active address book is a descendent of the genesis address book;

## Specification
Our specification has four parts.
1. First, we define the TSS **address book** and how we can use **proof keys** to link one 
address book to the next in a cryptographic chain of trust that binds arbitrary **metadata** 
to each address book in the chain. 
2. Next, we outline the information flow in the construction of a hinTS scheme, emphasizing 
that the main external output of each hinTS scheme, its **verification key**, is exactly the 
metadata bound to the corresponding address book in the chain of trust.
3. Third, we discuss the special case of the genesis block that initializes the chain of trust.
4. Finally, we tie everything together by specifying the `BlockProof` protobuf message a
Hiero network uses to externalize its block signatures.

**Important:** This specification is for developers working on the core protocol, block nodes,
and mirror nodes. We confine ourselves to just what is needed to correctly produce and consume 
the TSS protocol outputs in the block stream, taking as given a cryptography library that 
provides the API of the `HintsLibrary` and `HistoryLibrary` interfaces in the reference 
implementation in [4]. 

Readers interested in thoroughly understanding the reference implementation should refer to 
its [design documentation](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero-consensus-node/blob/main/hedera-node/docs/exact-weight-tss.md). 
Readers interested in the deeper details of the cryptography should consult [1].

### Schnorr proof keys and the address book chain of trust

Users of a Hiero network must apriori trust a large majority of the _originators_ of the network, 
which forms the root of trust rather than some cryptographic proof.
This is obvious since the originators will, by definition, hold the entire stake weight; 
and, even the gold standard of aBFT security is mathematically limited to a corruption threshold 
of strictly less than a third of the weight.

But users should never have to extend their trust beyond the aforementioned root 
(and the limits of aBFT fault tolerance and other cryptographic assumptions within hinTS). 
Every future change to the membership of the network must come with cryptographic proof that at least 
one third of the weight (and hence at least one honest node) voted for that membership change.

We propose a recursive proof mechanism that uses a succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge
(SNARK) based on honest nodes contributing signatures to address book. These signatures are computed using 
Schnorr private keys whose public keys are gossiped to the network and stored within the address book. 
The message used to gossip a Schnorr public key is,
```
message HistoryProofKeyPublicationTransactionBody {
  /**
   * The public key the submitting node intends to use when
   * contributing signatures for use in proving history
   * belongs to the chain of trust for the ledger id.
   */
  bytes history_public_key = 1;
} 
```

The network membership is characterized by a **TSS address book** made up of `(nodeId, history_public_key, weight)` 
triples; where the `history_public_key`s are the Schnorr public keys gossiped as above; 
and the `nodeId` and `weight` fields are identical to those in a current or candidate consensus roster.

It follows that every recursive proof construction derives from a **source roster** (and address book), 
and aims to prove a trustworthy transition to a **target roster** (and address book). The first 
time that TSS is enabled on a Hiero network is a special case in which the same roster serves as 
both source _and_ target; the TSS address book for this special roster is called the **genesis 
address book**. From that point forward, the SHA-256 hash of the genesis address book is the
 **ledger id**.
```
ledgerId = <genesisAddressBookHash>
```

In the reference implementation, as soon as the ledger id is computed, it is set in a singleton
with the State API key `HistoryService.LEDGER_ID` with `StateIdentifier` ordinal
[`42`](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero-consensus-node/blob/main/hapi/hedera-protobuf-java-api/src/main/proto/block/stream/output/state_changes.proto#L420).
This singleton has the simple type,
```
message ProtoBytes {
    bytes value = 1;
}
```
Any block stream consumer that wants to validate signatures should keep the value of this
singleton readily available, since it is an ingredient in every chain-of-trust proof. The
consumer might extract it from the genesis block, or fetch it from a trusted registry of
chain ids.

The honest nodes in the network prove every subsequent address book change 
--- with respect to the above ledger id --- by first using a deterministic 
policy to determine the hash of the target address book, then gossiping their 
Schnorr signatures on the hash of that address book after being
_concatenated with arbitrary metadata that should be trusted for that address book_. 
The message used to gossip these signatures is,
```
message HistoryProofSignatureTransactionBody {
  /**
   * The id of the proof construction this signature is contributing to.
   */
  uint64 construction_id = 1;

  /**
   * This node's signature on its computed history.
   */
  com.hedera.hapi.node.state.history.HistorySignature signature = 2;
}
```

Where we have,
```
/**
 * A piece of new history in the form of an address book hash and
 * associated metadata.
 */
message History {
  /**
   * The address book hash of the new history.
   */
  bytes address_book_hash = 1;
  /**
   * The metadata associated to the address book.
   */
  bytes metadata = 2;
}

/**
 * A node's signature blessing some new history.
 */
message HistorySignature {
  /**
   * The new history the node is signing.
   */
  History history = 1;
  /**
   * The node's signature on the canonical serialization of
   * the new history.
   */
  bytes signature = 2;
}
```

The honest nodes then use another deterministic policy to take a sufficient set of the
valid signatures as inputs to the recursive SNARK prover; compute the proof; and then 
gossip their vote for that proof as the evidence the roster transition is trustworthy.

The arbitrary metadata concatenated with the address book is the bridge between the
address book chain of trust and the hinTS signing scheme actually used to create TSS
signatures, as we see next.

### hinTS BLS keys and TSS signatures

When faced with a new candidate address book, the honest nodes in the network must
work together to setup the hinTS scheme for that address book. The first step
is to gossip a special, cryptographically "extended" form of the public BLS key 
-- called the hinTS key -- that they have generated for their individual use.
```
message HintsKeyPublicationTransactionBody {
  ...
  /**
   * The party's hinTS key.
   */
  bytes hints_key = 3;
}
```

Unlike simple BLS keys, these extended hinTS keys have information that can be **preprocessed** 
into an aggregated **verification key**. Given a verification key `VK` that aggregates the 
hinTS keys `{ k_1, k_2, ..., k_n }`, the hinTS scheme lets us replace (1) a linear-size list 
of partial signatures `{ s_1, s_2, ... s_n }` that verify under the respective keys; 
with (2) a single aggregate signature `S` (with claimed aggregate weight) that verifies under `VK`.

The honest nodes use a deterministic policy to choose which of the published hinTS
keys they will aggregate into the verification key for the target address book, then
gossip a vote on the resulting preprocessing output. The honest nodes adopt the `VK`
from the preprocessing output that receives votes from at least a third of the stake
weight in the source address book for the construction.

### The genesis block

We discussed above how the `VK` for the hinTS scheme of an address book is included
in the chain-of-trust proof that links that address book to the previous one. However,
chain must have a beginning---that is, a genesis address book with an initial hinTS
scheme.

For the genesis hinTS `VK`, there is no recursive proof. The genesis block itself
must be trusted. Specifically, the Hiero protocol guarantees the genesis block of
a network will include,
1. A `HistoryProofKeyPublicationTransactionBody` for strictly more than 2/3 of the
weight in the genesis roster.
2. The ledger id derived from the hash of the address book with these keys.
3. A `HistoryProofSignatureTransactionBody` on the `History` formed from this
ledger id and the genesis hinTS `VK` for greater than 1/2 of the weight in the genesis
roster.

If a stream consumer trusts it knows the ledger id for a network, it can then,
given the genesis block, verify the Schnorr keys and roster in that block hash
to the ledger id. Since this proves the Schnorr keys are trustworthy, their
signatures in the genesis block then establish the genesis hinTS key.

### Verifying `BlockProof`s as a stream consumer

A Hiero network externalizes its signatures in the following message.
```
message BlockProof {
  /**
   * The number of the block being proven via TSS signature.
   */
  uint64 block = 1;
  /**
   * If not the genesis block, the previous block root hash.
   */
  bytes previous_block_root_hash = 2;
  /**
   * The state hash at the start of the block.
   */
  bytes start_of_block_state_root_hash = 3;
    
  /**
   * If non-empty, the Merkle path from the root of this block to
   * a successor block whose root hash this signature applies to.
   */
  repeated MerkleSiblingHash sibling_hashes = 4;

  /**
   * The hinTS signature proving the block.
   */
  bytes hints_signature = 5; 
  /**
   * The hinTS verification key the signature verifies under.
   */
  bytes hints_verification_key = 6;

  /**
   * Proof the hinTS verification key is trustworthy.
   */
  oneof {
    /**
     * If this is the genesis block, a convenient listing of the contained
     * Schnorr signatures on the concatenation of the ledger id and genesis
     * hinTS verification key.
     */
    ListOfSchnorrSignatures schnorr_signatures = 7;
    /**
     * If this is not the genesis block, an uncompressed SNARK proof proving
     * the chain of trust from the ledger id to this hinTS verification key;
     * approximately 1.5MB.
     */
    bytes wraps_proof = 8;
    /**
     * If this is not the genesis block, a ZK-compressed SNARK proof proving
     * the chain of trust from the ledger id to this hinTS verification key;
     * approximately 1KB.
     */
    bytes wraps_proof_compressed = 9;
  }
}

message ListOfSchnorrSignatures{
    repeated bytes schnorr_signature = 1;
}
```
The verification procedure consists of the following steps in order:
1. verify the chain-of-trust proof using the SNARK verification key (hard-coded in the verifier).
   Note that the proof can take one of three forms: `schnorr_signatures`, `wraps_proof` or `wraps_proof_compressed`.
   The proof contains (as part of the SNARK statement) metadata, including the 256-bit hash of `hints_verification_key`.
2. assert that the SHA-256 hash of `hints_verification_key` equals the value from the proof above.
3. use the hinTS verification method to verify `hints_signature` with respect to `hints_verification_key`.

## Backwards Compatibility
Because we propose to enable hinTS TSS in tandem with the block stream detailed in
[HIP-1056](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero-improvement-proposals/pull/1056), this
change will be one just more part of a sharp and permanent discontinuity in the Hiero 
protocol. (Hedera may choose to publish TSS block proofs for all historical mainnet
blocks; but that is not part of the scope of this HIP.)

## Security Implications
The attack surface for forging hinTS signatures is essentially the same as already
exists with the V6 record stream today. If an attacker can steal the private keys of
nodes that hold greater than 1/2 of the stake weight, they can forge network signatures
on arbitrary blocks (whether that means listing RSA signatures or aggregating BLS
signatures). Node operators must therefore remain vigilant and follow best practices
to ensure the physical and cyber security of their machines.

## How to Teach This
For a HIP that adds new functionality or changes interface behaviors, it is
helpful to include a section on how to teach users, new and experienced, how to
apply the HIP to their work.

## Reference Implementation
Please refer to the `HintsService` and `HistoryService` in the Hiero consensus node
[repository](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero-consensus-node) for the reference 
implementation.

## Rejected Ideas
Before adopting hinTS, there was lengthy consideration of an inexact-weight threshold 
scheme that would approximate each node's stake weight by granting it a number of BLS 
key pairs called **shares**. Nodes with more stake would get more shares, and nodes 
with less stake would get fewer shares. Although this approach offered at least equal 
or better space and time efficiency than hinTS, the complexity and compromises inherent
with inexact weights made hinTS the better choice for Hiero networks.

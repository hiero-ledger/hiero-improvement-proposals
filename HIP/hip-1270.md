## Abstract:

Introduce a new Mirror Node API endpoint, `GET /api/v1/entities/{id}`, that resolves any Hedera entity identifier (shard.realm.num or alias) and returns a compact, normalized view with the entity type and a minimal set of common, cross-entity fields. This reduces ambiguity when a client only has an identifier and needs to determine the entity type and basic metadata without calling multiple type-specific endpoints.

## Motivation:

Today, clients must guess an entity's type and probe multiple endpoints (e.g., `/accounts/{id}`, `/contracts/{id}`, `/tokens/{id}`, `/topics/{id}`, etc.). This is cumbersome when:

- A user pastes an identifier of unknown type
- The identifier is an alias that could map to an account
- A workflow needs only shared metadata (creation time, deletion status, ledger, memo) before navigating to type-specific details

A single resolver endpoint improves developer experience, reduces round trips, and establishes a stable contract for cross-entity discovery that aligns with how Mirror Node already models entities internally. Including this endpoint should reduce egress traffic and improve performance.

## Rationale:

- A unified resolver reflects the Mirror Node's normalized `entity` model.
- Returning a minimal, common shape keeps the response stable over time and avoids leaking type-specific concerns.
- Supporting multiple identifier forms (0.0.x, alias) matches existing Mirror Node resolution behavior and avoids fragmentation.

## User stories

- As a wallet, I want to paste any identifier and immediately know if it is an account, contract, token, topic, file, or schedule so I can route users appropriately.
- As an indexer, I want a single API to normalize identifiers to `0.0.x` and detect the entity type before fetching type-specific details.
- As a developer, I want to quickly check basic entity metadata (created timestamp, deletion status, memo) without guessing which endpoint to query.

## Specification:

The REST API will be extended with a unified resolver endpoint that accepts any Hedera entity identifier and returns shared entity metadata.

### Route:

/api/v1/entities/{id}

### Proposed Response Structure:

```json
{
  "entity_id": "0.0.1234",
  "type": "ACCOUNT|CONTRACT|TOKEN|TOPIC|FILE|SCHEDULE|NODE",
  "memo": "optional string",
  "deleted": false,
  "created_timestamp": "1695854412.123456789",
  "expiry_timestamp": "1727390412.000000000",
  "auto_renew_period": 7776000,
  "auto_renew_account": "0.0.5678",
  "alias": "optional alias string"
}
```

### Existence Checks

Consider `HEAD /api/v1/entities/{id}` for existence checks without a body.

## Backwards Compatibility

Additive. No existing endpoints change. Clients can continue using type-specific endpoints directly.

## Security Implications

None beyond existing Mirror Node data access. The endpoint only aggregates already-public metadata. Rate limits and existing auth (if any) apply.

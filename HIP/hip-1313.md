## Abstract
This proposal introduces a second set of limits on how quickly new entities,
like accounts or tokens, can be created on the Hiero network. These new limits,
called **high-volume throttles**, sit alongside the existing standard throttles.
Users can choose to use these high-volume throttles by setting a simple flag in
their transaction. When they do this, they agree to pay extra during busy times
to access this additional capacity. The standard throttles remain unchanged,
with their own capacity and fixed prices, ensuring regular users experience no
disruptions.

## Motivation
Networks like Hiero use limits, or throttles, to manage the flow of
transactions. This prevents any single activity from overwhelming the system,
protecting against overuse of storage, processing power, or network bandwidth.
For instance, creating new accounts might be limited to a few per second across
the entire network, while transferring tokens could allow thousands per second.

These throttles work well for everyday use but can slow down applications that
need to create many items quickly, such as onboarding large groups of users.
During peak times, these applications face delays as they wait for available
slots under the standard throttles. This proposal adds a way for users to access
extra capacity when needed, without affecting those using the standard throttle
system.

## Rationale
The design creates a new parallel system for handling transactions that create
new items, without changing the existing throttle system.

### Standard Throttle System (Unchanged)
Transactions without the special flag use the existing throttles and prices:
- Fixed costs based on the current fee schedule.
- Predictable capacity that operates independently of the high-volume system.
- No need for any changes in existing applications.

### High-Volume Throttle System (New)
Transactions with the flag set use a separate set of throttles with the
following characteristics:
- Dedicated capacity that does not overlap with the standard system.
- Prices that increase based on how busy this high-volume capacity is,
  encouraging efficient use.
   - When the high-volume capacity is idle, prices match the rates of the
     standard throttle system.
   - Prices in the high-volume system follow a clear formula set by network
     governance, avoiding surprises from market fluctuations or hidden rules.
- Users must actively choose this option and can set a maximum price they're
  willing to pay.

Importantly, choosing high-volume does not give transactions priority over
others; all are processed in the order they arrive, maintaining fairness.

## User Stories
- **As a developer**, I can opt to pay more during busy periods to create items
  faster without being blocked by standard throttles.
- **As a developer**, I can set a maximum fee for high-volume transactions to
  control costs.
- **As a developer**, I can estimate costs in advance to plan my operations
  effectively.
- **As a developer**, my existing applications continue working unchanged using
  standard throttles.
- **As a developer**, my transactions are processed fairly alongside all others,
  regardless of the limit system used.
- **As a new user**, I pay standard prices by default and only encounter higher
  costs if I explicitly choose the high-volume throttle system **and** during
  peak periods for the specific transaction Iâ€™m submitting.
- **As a network operator**, high-volume capacity is protected from abuse
  through increasing costs, making prolonged attacks expensive.

## Specification

### Key Concepts
- **Throttle**: A limit on the volume of transactions to protect network
  resources.
- **Entity Creation**: Making new items like accounts, tokens, or files on the
  network.
- **Utilization Percentage**: How much of the available capacity is currently in
  use (0% empty, 100% full).
- **Pricing Curve**: A formula that determines how much extra to charge based on
  utilization.

### Transaction Changes
A new optional field is added to the basic transaction structure:

```protobuf
syntax = "proto3";
message TransactionBody {
  *// Existing fields remain unchanged...
  /**
   * If set to true, this transaction uses high-volume throttles and pricing
   * for entity creation. It only affects supported transaction types; otherwise,
   * it is ignored.
   */*
  bool high_volume = 25;
}
```

This field applies to transactions involving entity creation, such as:
- `ScheduleCreate`
- `CryptoCreate`
- `CryptoTransfer` (when creating new accounts)
- `ConsensusCreateTopic`
- `CryptoApproveAllowance`
- `NodeCreate`
- `FileCreate`
- `FileAppend`
- `TokenMint`
- `ContractCall` (for entities created inside the contract)
- `ContractCreate`
- `EthereumTransaction` (for entities created inside)
- `TokenCreate`
- `TokenAssociateToAccount`
- `TokenAirdrop`
- `TokenClaimAirdrop`

For example, a `CryptoTransfer` that creates accounts uses high-volume pricing
for those creations but standard throttles for the transfers themselves.

### High-Volume Throttles Configuration
High-volume throttles are defined separately in the network's throttle settings.
Each has its own capacity, marked as high-volume:

```json
{
  "buckets": [
    {
      "burstPeriodMs": 15000,
      "name": "HighVolumeThroughputThrottles",
      "highVolume": true,
      "throttleGroups": [
        {
          "milliOpsPerSec": 10500000,
          "operations": [
            "ScheduleCreate",
            "CryptoCreate"
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Pricing Configuration
Pricing for high-volume is set in the fee definitions:

```protobuf
syntax = "proto3";

message ServiceFeeDefinition {
  // ... existing fields ...

  /**
   * High-volume rate pricing configuration for this fee definition.
   * If not specified, high-volume rates are not supported for this
   * transaction type, and the transaction will be charged the standard fee.
   */
  HighVolumeRateDefinition high_volume_rates = 5;
}

/**
 * Defines the configuration for high-volume rate pricing.
 * If high-volume pricing is in effect, the resulting fee multiplier will be a
 * value between 1 (standard fee) and `max_multiplier` (cost ceiling). If a
 * `pricing_curve` is specified, then the multiplier will be determined by the
 * utilization percentage of the high-volume throttle and the pricing curve. If
 * no `pricing_curve` is specified, then the multiplier will be interpolated
 * on an _effective_ pricing curve described by a straight line
 * between the standard fee and `max_multiplier` * `standard_fee`.
 */
message HighVolumeRateDefinition {
  /**
   * Maximum multiplier to prevent extreme pricing (cost ceiling).
   * Given the normal price of the transaction, the computed high-volume price
   * will not exceed `max_multiplier` * `standard_fee`. Provides predictability
   * for users regardless of utilization. The minimum price will be the
   * `standard_fee`. This value is divided by 1,000,000 and then added to the
   * minimum value of 1.
   * <p>
   * ##Example
   * A value of `2,450,300` results in an _effective_ floating point multiplier
   * of `3.4503`.<br/>
   * A value of `0` results in an _effective_ floating point
   * multiplier of `1.0`.
   */
  uint32 max_multiplier = 2;

  /**
   * Pricing curve configuration defining how fees scale with high-volume
   * capacity utilization. Given a utilization percentage (0.0 to 1.0), the
   * pricing curve determines the multiplier to use. If the curve returns a
   * multiplier greater than `max_multiplier`, then `max_multiplier`
   * will be used.
   * <p>
   * If the pricing_curve is not specified, then the multiplier will be linearly
   * interpolated between 1 and `max_multiplier`.
   */
  PricingCurve pricing_curve = 3;
}

/**
 * Defines the pricing curve used for high-volume rate calculations.
 * This can be one of several types of curves, each with its own formula for
 * calculating the multiplier based on the utilization percentage of the
 * high-volume throttle.
 */
message PricingCurve {
  oneof curve_type {
    PiecewiseLinearCurve piecewise_linear = 1;
  }
}

/**
 * Contains a set of points (utilization, multiplier) that define a piecewise
 * linear curve for high-volume pricing. Each point represents a linear segment
 * between two utilization thresholds. The multiplier to use is interpolated
 * between these points based on the current utilization percentage.
 *
 * For example, given points
 *  - (0.0, 1.0)
 *  - (0.5, 2.0)
 *  - (1.0, 5.0)
 * The multiplier for a utilization of 0.75 would be interpolated between the
 * second and third points, resulting in a multiplier of 3.5.
 */
message PiecewiseLinearCurve {
  /**
   * A list of points defining the piecewise linear curve.
   * Each point is a pair of (utilization_percentage, multiplier). The list
   * must be sorted by utilization_percentage in ascending order, and
   * sub-ordered by multiplier in ascending order for points with the same
   * utilization percentage. It is legal to have two points with the same
   * utilization percentage, but they must have different multipliers.
   * This allows the creation of stepped pricing curves.
   */
  repeated PiecewiseLinearPoint points = 1;
}

/**
 * Represents a single point in a piecewise linear curve, with a utilization
 * percentage and the corresponding multiplier.
 */
message PiecewiseLinearPoint {
  /**
   * The utilization percentage for this point, in thousandths of one percent.
   * This value must be between 0 and 100,000, inclusive.
   */
  uint32 utilization_percentage = 1;

  /**
   * The multiplier to apply at this utilization percentage.
   * This value is divided by 1,000,000 then added to 1.
   */
  uint32 multiplier = 2;
}
```

Limits and pricing are configured independently for flexibility.

### Fee Calculation Steps
For high-volume transactions:
1. Measure current utilization of high-volume throttles.
2. Compute standard fee.
3. Determine multiplier from pricing curve (capped at `max_multiplier`).
4. Final `fee = standard fee Ã— multiplier` (but not exceeding user's
   `maxTransactionFee`).

## Mirror Node Changes
1. Mirror Node new API for high volume rates
2. Mirror Node new API for high volume rate estimates
3. Other changes?

## Backwards Compatibility
No changes for transactions without the `high_volume` flag. Existing
applications work as before.

## Security Implications
High-volume does not alter transaction order or bypass total network limits on
storage. Increasing prices deter abuse, as sustaining high utilization becomes
costly.

## How to Teach This

### For Developers
Use high-volume like this (Java SDK example):

```java
AccountCreateTransaction tx = new AccountCreateTransaction()
    .setKey(publicKey)
    .setInitialBalance(Hbar.from(10))
    .setHighVolume(true)  // Opt in
    .setMaxTransactionFee(Hbar.from(5));  // Set cost limit
```

Always check current rates:

```java
HighVolumeRateInfo info = client.getHighVolumeRate(HieroFunctionality.CRYPTO_CREATE);
if (info.getCurrentHighVolumeFee().compareTo(Hbar.from(3)) <= 0) {
    // Use high-volume
} else {
    // Fall back to standard
}
```

Use high-volume for bursts or time-sensitive tasks; stick to standard for
routine work.

### For SDK Maintainers
Add methods for setting `high_volume`. Enforce fee limits and provide helpers
for estimation.

### For Users
High-volume throttles open a new avenue to unblock use cases that require entity
creation during peak times while maintaining fair ordering. Always set price
limits when using high-volume throttles.

### For Operators
Allocate capacity, set pricing curves, and monitor usage to balance
accessibility and protection.

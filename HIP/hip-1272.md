## Abstract:

Introduce a new Mirror Node API endpoint, `GET /api/v1/entities/{id}`, that resolves any Hedera entity identifier (shard.realm.num, or EVM address) and returns a minimal response with the entity type and a link to the type-specific endpoint. This reduces ambiguity when a client only has an identifier and needs to determine the entity type without calling multiple type-specific endpoints.

## Motivation:

Today, clients must guess an entity's type and probe multiple endpoints (e.g., `/accounts/{id}`, `/contracts/{id}`, `/tokens/{id}`, `/topics/{id}`, etc.). This is cumbersome when:

- A user pastes an identifier of unknown type
- The identifier is an EVM address that could map to an account or contract
- A workflow needs to identify the entity type before navigating to type-specific details

A single resolver endpoint improves developer experience, reduces round trips, and establishes a stable contract for cross-entity discovery that aligns with how Mirror Node already models entities internally. Including this endpoint should reduce egress traffic and improve performance.

## Rationale:

- A unified resolver reflects the Mirror Node's normalized `entity` model.
- Returning common fields (id, type, created_timestamp, deleted, memo) plus a link keeps the API useful while avoiding type-specific complexity.
- Supporting multiple identifier forms (0.0.x, or EVM address) matches existing Mirror Node resolution behavior and avoids fragmentation.

## User stories

- As a wallet, I want to paste any identifier and immediately know if it is an account, contract, token, or topic so I can route users appropriately.
- As an indexer, I want a single API to normalize identifiers to `0.0.x` and detect the entity type before fetching type-specific details.
- As a developer, I want to quickly identify entity type and get a direct link to fetch full details without guessing which endpoint to query.
- As a DApp developer, I want to resolve EVM addresses to their corresponding Hedera entity type and canonical ID.

## Specification:

The REST API will be extended with a unified resolver endpoint that accepts any Hedera entity identifier and returns minimal entity metadata.

### Route:

`GET /api/v1/entities/{id}`

Note: The term "entities" aligns with existing Mirror Node APIs and HAPI nomenclature for Hedera identifiers.

### Parameters:

- `{id}`: The entity identifier, which can be:
  - Hedera entity ID format: `shard.realm.anum` (e.g., `0.0.1234`)
  - EVM address (0x-prefixed hex string for accounts and contracts)

### Supported Entity Types:

The endpoint will initially support entity types that have existing Mirror Node endpoints:
- `ACCOUNT`
- `CONTRACT` 
- `TOKEN`
- `TOPIC`
- `SCHEDULE`

Future support may be added for new entities as Mirror Node endpoints become available.

### Response Structure:

#### Success Response (200 OK):

```json
{
  "id": "0.0.1234",
  "type": "ACCOUNT",
  "created_timestamp": "1695854412.123456789",
  "deleted": false,
  "memo": "Account memo",
  "evm_address": "0x00000000000000000000000000000000000004d2",
  "link": "/api/v1/accounts/0.0.1234"
}
```

Fields:
- `id`: The canonical Hedera entity ID (shard.realm.num format)
- `type`: The entity type (ACCOUNT, CONTRACT, TOKEN, or TOPIC)
- `created_timestamp`: When the entity was created on the Hedera network
- `deleted`: Whether the entity has been deleted
- `memo`: The entity's memo field (may be empty string)
- `evm_address`: (Optional) The EVM address for accounts and contracts
- `link`: Path to the type-specific endpoint for full entity details

#### Error Response (404 Not Found):

```json
{
  "_status": {
    "messages": [
      {
        "message": "Not found"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Backwards Compatibility

Additive. No existing endpoints change. Clients can continue using type-specific endpoints directly.

## Security Implications

None beyond existing Mirror Node data access. The endpoint only aggregates already-public metadata. Rate limits and existing auth (if any) apply.

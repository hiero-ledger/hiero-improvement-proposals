## Abstract
Ethereum's Pectra upgrade (activated May 7, 2025) introduced 11 EIPs, but not all of them are applicable to the Hiero network. 
This HIP defines the adoption of Pectra for the Smart Contract Service by distinguishing which EIPs are applicable to Hiero versus non-applicable.

## Motivation
To maintain EVM compatibility, applicable EIPs introduced in Ethereum's Pectra upgrade must be supported by the Hiero network.

## Rationale
Maintaining EVM compatibility is a core goal of the Hiero network, so updates from Ethereum releases must be adopted. 
However, not every EIP needs to be implemented.  Each EIP needs to be evaluated individually for applicability.  
Some EIPs address functionality that is (i) not supported by Hiero (e.g., blobs), (ii) aimed at improving validators—which have no Hiero equivalent—or 
(iii) focuses on layers outside of L1 execution engine. All other EIPs should be considered for support.

## User stories
- As a smart contract developer, I want to access BLS12-381 precompiles as described in EIP-2537.
- As a smart contract developer, I expect the gas cost for call data to increase as described in EIP-7623.
- As a smart contract developer, I want to set code for EOAs and execute it when the EOA address is called, as described in EIP-7702.
- As an end user, I want to be able to be able to call an EOA that has executable code.
- As an EOA, I want to be able to set execution code for myself via signing an authorization and including the authorization in a transaction.

## Specification
The eleven EIPs in the Pectra release are listed below and categorized as either applicable or non-applicable to Hiero.

## **Applicable EIPs**

### EIP-2537

[EIP-2537](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2537) introduces new precompiles for BLS12-381 operations. Besu has already implemented these precompiles. The necessary work for Hiero is to make them available within the EVM.  The new precompile functions and addresses are summarized in this table.  These precompile functions can be called utilizing functions such as `call` and `staticcall`

| Function Name | Precompile address |
| --- | --- |
| BLS12_G1ADD | 0x0b |
| BLS12_G1MSM | 0x0c |
| BLS12_G2ADD | 0x0d |
| BLS12_G2MSM | 0x0e |
| BLS12_PAIRING_CHECK | 0x0f |
| BLS12_MAP_FP_TO_G1 | 0x10 |
| BLS12_MAP_FP2_TO_G2 | 0x11 |

### EIP-7623

[EIP-7623](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7623) increases the gas cost of calldata to reduce the maximum block size. Although the limit to maximum block size and block gas limit do not directly apply to Hiero, for EVM equivalence, Hiero will also adopt these gas costs. The necessary changes have been implemented in the `PragueGasCalculator` in Besu, but these changes must be made available to the gas calculator used by Hiero EVM.

More specifically, the gas calculation remains the same but a minimum floor value defined as
`TOTAL_COST_FLOOR_PER_TOKEN ***** tokens_in_calldata` is introduced

where `TOTAL_COST_FLOOR_PER_TOKEN = 10`

and `tokens_in_calldata = zero_bytes_in_calldata + nonzero_bytes_in_calldata * 4`

### EIP-7702

[EIP-7702](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7702) is the most complex EIP to implement from the Pectra release. It allows for setting and executing contract code for EOAs. HIP-related details can be found in HIP-#### (link once available).

### Non-Applicable EIPs

The non-applicable EIPs are described and categorized below.

- EIPs that enhance blob support
    - [EIP-7691](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7691)
    - [EIP-7840](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7840)
- EIPs related to Ethereum validators
    - [EIP-6110](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6110)
    - [EIP-7002](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7002)
    - [EIP-7251](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7251)
    - [EIP-7685](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7685)
- EIPs related to Ethereum 2.0
    - [EIP-2935](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2935)
    - [EIP-7549](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7549)

### Impact on Mirror Node
EIP-2537 and EIP-7623 do not meaningfully impact the mirror node beyond normal acceptance of the new code once it is available for simulation.  
EIP-7702 impact can be found in the related HIP <HIP for EIP-770s> link.

### Impact on SDK
EIP-2537 and EIP-7623 do not meaningfully impact the SDK.
EIP-7702 impact can be found in the related HIP <HIP for EIP-770s> link.

## Backwards Compatibility
EIP-2537 does not impact backwards compatibility.  
EIP-7623 alters the gas consumption for transaction and this can impact new and subsequent interactions with existing contracts by end users.

## Security Implications
There are no known security implications from EIP-2537 and EIP-7623.
EIP-7702 impact can be found in the related HIP <HIP for EIP-770s> link.

## How to Teach This
Hiero will support EIP-2537, EIP-7623, and EIP-7702 to maintain EVM compatibility. Other Pectra EIPs are not applicable to Hiero.    
Documentation for these and other Pectra related EIPs are available via the official Ethereum EIP website <eips.ethereum.org>

## Rejected Ideas
None.

## Open Issues
None.

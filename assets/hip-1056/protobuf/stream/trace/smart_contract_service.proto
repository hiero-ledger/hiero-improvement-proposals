 * transaction in its Hiero transactional unit, this message simply
 * sets `written_keys_are_non_identical_state_changes` to true;
 * meaning a stream consumer should extract the written keys from
 * the Hiero unit's SlotKey state changes that match this message's
 * `contract_id` (but ignoring any* MapUpdateChange with
 * `identical` set to true).
 * <p>
 * In the less common case that an EVM transaction is one of
 * several in its Hiero transactional unit (e.g., because it is
 * one of several ContractCalls in an AtomicBatch); this message
 * explicitly traces the storage slots that were written during
